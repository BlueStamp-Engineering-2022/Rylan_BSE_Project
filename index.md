[![Starter project](https://res.cloudinary.com/marcomontalbano/image/upload/v1655914401/video_to_markdown/images/youtube--cLZHildWNxU-c05b58ac6eb4c4700831b2b3070cd403.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLZHildWNxU "Starter Project")

My starter project was the useless machine. It's main components was a switch, limiter switch, motor, and an arm. When the switch was pushed it would activate the motor, moving the arm that was attached to it. The arm would then come out from the box and then hit the switch. This causes the electric current to be reversed causing the arm to move back into the box. The base of the arm would then hit the limiter switch when moving back into the box, causing it to stop moving. I really enjoyed the soldering in the project as it was the most hands on. I struggled most on the assembly of the machine but besides that this project was really fun.

My first milestone was getting retropie onto my raspberry pi. To do this I had to install a raspberry pi imager. This is becuase I wanted to use a different os from raspberry's own os. Through this I had to load retropie onto a sd card which I would then put into my raspberry pi to run retropie. I used a thumbdrive to then install the games I wanted to play onto the raspberry pi. The part I enjoyed most so far was just seeing these retro games running smoothly with no problems and then finally getting to play these games. The hardest part about this was getting retropie to boot on the raspberry pi. What I plan to do for my next milestone is to make my own controller to play these games with.
